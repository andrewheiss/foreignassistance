The annual report to Congress on U.S foreign assistance flows is required by the Foreign Assistance Act, Section 634 and is the authoritative data set of U.S. foreign assistance. The annual update of the dataset contains data of United States Government (USG) foreign assistance since 1945. Foreign assistance is categorized as either economic assistance or military assistance. Foreign assistance is reported by recipient country and organized by geographic region, without distinction between developed and developing countries. Any country which has received cumulative economic or military assistance over $500,000 since 1945 and is considered an “Independent State” by the U.S. Department of State merits an individual country reporting."
