It returned on February 3, 2025, but it’s not clear how long it will be available.\nAs a backup, I’ve uploaded the entire ForeignAssistance.gov dataset to a Datasette website/API at https://foreignassistance-data.andrewheiss.com/. Everything as of December 19, 2024 is available there, both as a queryable SQL database and as downloadable CSV files.\nTo simplify things, I’ve also provided links for each individual dataset below."
